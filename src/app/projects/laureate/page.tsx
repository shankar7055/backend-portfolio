        <h1> Laureate </h1>
        <time> December 03, 2018 </time>
        <p> Laureate is a global leader in higher education with more than 70 educational institutions and 1 million students in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. </p>
        <p> I was responsible for the research, interaction design, and copywriting for Laureate, working with two visual designers to redesign the e-commerce experience. </p>

        <h2> Conveying Trust of an Education Titan </h2>
        <p> The Laureate company approached us to help them communicate the best of a robust education group and bring out the critical information for people to enroll in online distance learning. </p>
        <p> The project involved redesigning the Laureate e-commerce website and optimizing the enrollment flow of information needed for students in online distance learning. </p>
        <p> With a three-month timeline, we focused on delivering the education experience more effectively and meaningfully. </p>

        <ImageComponent width={1280} height={720} src="/projects/laureate/Overview_Laureate-p-1080.png" alt="" />

        <h2> Laureate Immersion </h2>
        <p> We started the project by investigating the requirements for online distance learning and the nature of education service provision thoroughly and quickly. As a result, we conducted ethnographic research to understand the three stakeholders’ perspectives in the service with students, institutions managers, and university center owners. </p>
        <h2>How do you choose online courses?</h2>
        <p> We interviewed 6 university center owners, 12 undergrad students, and 4 institutions managers in São Paulo. We aimed to gather insights into how they feel, perceive, and think about online distance learning. </p>

              <h3> “The course needs approval by MEC.” </h3>
              <p> Students felt insecure navigating the old website because they could not determine if institutions and courses had approval by MEC, the Brazilian federal education agency. </p>

              <h3> “I want a university center close to my home or work.” </h3>

              <p> Students could get discounts that would make up to 100% of the monthly fee without even sitting to an admission exam, determined by their scores on ENEM. </p>

              <h3> “I am doing online graduation to help me get a better job.” </h3>
              <p> Students who opted for online graduation envisioned the courses as an investment to replace their present job for future ones with better quality of life. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p> Insights from our discovery work revealed many areas of improvement for content that connects to the user and transfers the education quality and trustworthiness of Laureate to the website. </p>
        <h2> Organizing Content and Workflows </h2>
        <p> Before we started to design, it was essential to have a holistic approach to each institution’s enrollment flow and existing content required for the course. </p>
        <p> After we mapped out the workflows, we came up with a single proposal that could improve user experience and optimize the development and maintenance of the flow during a moment of heavy online traffic. </p>

        <ImageComponent width={1280} height={720} src="/projects/laureate/workflow-laureate-p-2000.png" alt="" />

        <p> With the new workflow, Laureate can track information at each step by the user if they abandoned the funnel halfway through, enabling them to send more relevant and personalized information. </p>
        <h2> Introducing Laureate </h2>
        <p> We designed the new e-commerce experience to convey trust for students with straightforward navigation and content that showcases the university brands, institutions, and courses approved by MEC. </p>

        <VideoComponent src="../projects/laureate/Coursepage-compress-transcode.mp4" />

        <h3> Designed for scale </h3>
        <p> We conceived the visual design as a flexible system that adapts the new application model to all universities’ brand systems, focused on users’ actions in each journey step. </p>

        <VideoComponent src="../projects/laureate/desktop-linkme_1-transcode.mp4" />

        <h3> Quick application process </h3>
        <p> With a few steps and questions, students could apply for the courses. We fast-tracked the process using the discounts provided by the ENEM scores - a perfect match of motivation and ease of use. </p>

        <VideoComponent src="../projects/laureate/Screens-Motion-1-transcode.mp4" />

        <h3> Easy decision making </h3>
        <p> We designed the new course page to bring all the essential information for students. We tell a story presenting the seal of approval by MEC, a summary of the course, the extent of its content with an online class preview, leading market indicators for the profession, and frequently asked questions about the occupation. </p>
        
        <h2> Results </h2>
        <p> The redesign of the e-commerce and the enrollment flow of Laureate had a significant impact on acquisition, activation and retention metrics. </p>
